CERTIFICATION:

As the admitting physician responsible for the patient’s care, I certify that this patient requires inpatient hospital services to protect life, prevent serious disability, or avoid death. The patient’s  condition was severe and could not be safely managed outside of a hospital setting. Admission  was necessary to provide the level of care needed to stabilize the patient and prevent further  deterioration. It is my reasonable expectation, based on the patient's current medical condition  and the necessary plan of care, that this patient will require hospital care spanning at least two midnights.​
