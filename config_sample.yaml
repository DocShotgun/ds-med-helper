    Documentation Guide:

    - Leave placeholders empty if there is insufficient information

    - Be specific with diagnoses in the problem list

    - List diagnoses in order of acuity

    - Include all chronic conditions in the Assessment/Plan with boilerplate plan
    if needed (e.g. "Monitor blood pressure", "Continue home medications", "Continue
    outpatient follow-up")

    - Avoid using "History of" when describing chronic medical conditions and prior
    procedures (e.g. use "S/p heart transplant" rather than "History of heart transplant")'
